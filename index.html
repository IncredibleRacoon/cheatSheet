            <h1>Git</h1>
            <p>
                Git is the most popular version control system that is currently available.
                It was initialized by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
            </p>
            <h2>Setup your repository</h2>
            <p>
                In this chapter you will learn the basics of how to set up a repository
                and how the connection to your favorite version control provider is set.
            </p>
            <h3>Create repository</h3>
            <p>
                To create a repository you need to go to the
                the version control provider of your choice (git based).
                Here you should be able to create a new repository within
                the startscreen.
            </p>
            <h3>Clone repository</h3>
            <p>
                Now you need to clone the repository in order to develop on
                your local machine. For that you need the SSH url of your repository.
                You can find the url typically in the UI of the version control
                provider. Make sure to copy the SSH url and nothing else. Then you have
                to run the following command in the terminal/ console right in the direction
                you want to work on the project:
            </p>
            <div class="terminalCode">$ git clone <i>SSH_Url</i></div>
            <p>
                After this you should see the files you created in this folder.
            </p>
            <h2>Work with the repository</h2>
            <p>
                Now where you know how to set up a repo, we can move on and learn how to
                take advantage of this. In this chapter you will learn the basics to
                develop local and keep it up to date outside of your machine.
            </p>
            <h3>Stage files</h3>
            <p>
                To tell git which files you finally want to load to the servers of the provider,
                you need to add them with the logical command:
            </p>
            <div class="terminalCode">$ git add <i>file_you_want_to_stage</i></div>
            <p>
                If you dont type a file but just a dot (".") then you stage all changes
                you have done.
            </p>
            <h3>Commit changes</h3>
            <p>
                Commits are the essential part of git version control. You can compare
                these to backups. To create a commit, you first need to stage changes. Only
                these are taken into account. Then you have to type the following command:
            </p>
            <div class="terminalCode">$ git commit -m "<i>commit_message</i>"</div>
            <p>
                The commit message should tell the changes. There are a few conventions that go along
                with them. For example you should always use the verb in the imperative like "Add file"
                or "Change footer style". Furthermore you should commit pretty often, so that you
                can describe your changes in one line. If you need more than one line, you can leave
                the <i>-m</i> and the message out of the command. If you do this, git automatically
                opens the texteditor you set, where vim is the default.
            </p>
            <h3>Push commits</h3>
            <p>
                To finally upload the changes in the online filesystem, you need the call the <i>push</i>
                command:
            </p>
            <div class="terminalCode">$ git push <i>origin target_branch</i></div>
            <p>
                The default target-branch is called <i>main</i>. In the next section we talk how to
                change branches and what they are good for.
            </p>
            <h3>Branches</h3>
            <p>
                If you dont want just one logical line of commits, for example if you release the
                main branch to the public, you dont want the user to update the program for every single
                push. To avoid this, you can add a branch to your project, for example a developer
                branch where you develop features or fix bugs. With the following command
                you can create a new branch:
            </p>
            <div class="terminalCode">$ git branch <i>branch_name</i></div>
            <p>
                To show all branches you can simply leave out the branch name.
                The branch where youre in, is shown with an extra symbol.
                If you want to change your current branch, you can to this by
                typing the following lines:
            </p>
            <div class="terminalCode">$ git checkout <i>branch_name</i></div>
            <p>
                To create a branch and instantly change to it, you can add
                a <i>-b</i> tag to the above command.
            </p>
            <h3>Merge branches</h3>
            <p>
                If you want to merge two branches or in other words, put the code with its
                features together, you can this that way:
            </p>
            <div class="terminalCode">$ git merge <i>branch_name</i></div>
            <p>
                This will take the changes you've commited in <i>branch_name</i> and
                add them to the branch you're currently in.
            </p>
